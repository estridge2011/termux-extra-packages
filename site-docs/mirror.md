% Mirror of termux.net

This is an archive of [termux.net](https://termux.net). Unlike main repository, it also stores old versions of packages.

***

### Warning

I'm closing Termux-Mirror repository in the near future.

Since Termux uses a **rolling-release**, downgrading packages is completely unsupported and we should ensure that Termux users have up-to-date packages.

After that, site [termux.xeffyr.ml](https://termux.xeffyr.ml/) will serve only Termux Extra Packages.
